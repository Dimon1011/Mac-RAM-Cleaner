# Mac-RAM-Cleaner
This repository contains a simple Python script to help clean your RAM and potentially improve the performance of your MacBook Pro M1. The script clears cache files and purges inactive memory, which may help free up some memory and address certain performance issues.

Please note that this script may not resolve all performance problems on your MacBook Pro M1. If you continue to experience slowness after running the script, you might need to investigate other potential causes such as background processes, outdated software, or hardware issues.

To use the script, follow the instructions in the README file. Always exercise caution when using scripts that require administrator privileges, and make sure to back up your important data before making any changes to your system.
